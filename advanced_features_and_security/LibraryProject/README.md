# Introduction to Django Development Environment Setup

## Objective
The goal of this task is to gain familiarity with **Django** by setting up a Django development environment and creating a basic Django project.  
It's meant for me to learn the workflow of Django projects, including project creation, running the development server, and exploring the project structure.

I will install Django and creat a new project named **LibraryProject**.  
This setup serves as the foundation for developing Django applications and understanding how different project components work together.
